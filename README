WebappsInstantMessenger
=======================
This is a fully-featured client and server for sending instant
messages with a GUI. It's pretty much what you'd expect from
an instant messenger, though we did create a buddy system
(which was outside the scope of the assignment). It operates
off of a database for usernames/passwords and buddies, so it
can't be run as-is.
